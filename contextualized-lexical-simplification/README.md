# Contextualized Lexical Simplification

The [evaluation datset for contextualized lexical simplification](./contextualized-lexical-simplification-hobo-evaluation-set-2022.tsv) was collected as part of Eliza Hobo's [MSc thesis](https://openresearch.amsterdam/en/page/89469/msc-thesis---vu---contextualized-lexical-simplification-for).

The dataset contains 96 sentences, followed by the corresponding complex word and the possible simplifications.

The dataset can also be found in the [github repository](https://github.com/clap-lab/makkie/blob/main/Simplification/data/dutch-data.tsv) of the authors.

## Sentence Selection
The starting point for the dataset was a collection of ~50 documents provided by the Communications Department of the City of Amsterdam.
The documents have diverse sources and purposes (e.g. reports, citizen letters, newsletters, etc.) and cover a variety of topics (legal, medical, urban planning, etc.).

Using the [list of complex words](https://www.amsterdam.nl/schrijfwijzer/moeilijke-woorden/), Eliza sampled ~100 sentences which contain a complex word.

## Annotation
The annotation was conducted via a form filled in by 23 annotators, all highly-educated native Dutch speakers.
Annotators could either select a pre-filled option generated by an exising simplification model, or propose another suitable alternatives on their own.

## Further details

Further details about the dataset creation, as well as the developed LSBertje model can be found in the corresponding paper.
